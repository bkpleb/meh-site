                <ol>
<p>There is now an increasing number of online businesses that accept Lightning payments. </p>
<p>On-chain Bitcoin transactions don&#39;t scale for small amounts, which makes it impractical for everyday business. Hence, the use of Lightning Network enables almost instantaneous payments for low fees.</p>
<p>There are a couple options to choose from depending on technical expertise and whether you want to incorporate LN functionality directly into your website&#39;s codebase or integrate with an e-commerce platform.  Based on your preferences and how you want to entrust your funds, determine whether you want to run your own LN node like <a href="https://github.com/raspiblitz/raspiblitz">RaspiBlitz</a> and <a href="https://umbrel.com/umbrelos">Umbrel</a> or using custodial LN wallets.</p>
<p><strong>Payment Processors/Gateways</strong></p>
<p>Payment processors specializing in Lightning payments, such as <a href="https://btcpayserver.org/">BTCPay Server</a> and <a href="https://opennode.com/">OpenNode</a>, are popular because of streamlined solutions. Most processors not only have e-commerce platform plugins but also facilitate APIs and code libraries.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>BTCPay Server: It comes with integrations into platforms like <a href="https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Shopify/">Shopify</a>, <a href="https://docs.btcpayserver.org/WooCommerce/">WooCommerce</a>, <a href="https://zapier.com/apps/btcpay-server/integrations">Zapier</a>, etc. It has several <a href="https://docs.btcpayserver.org/Guide/#features">features</a> from self-hosted software (great for privacy &amp; trust), no KYC to LN support for various implementations. You will need to run BTCPay on your own server or use a third-party host such as Google Cloud. For custom integration for your site, use <a href="https://docs.btcpayserver.org/CustomIntegration/">BTCPay API</a>, which offers client and server-side pairing methods. Setting up and configuring BTCPay Server may be technically challenging, making it slightly inconvenient.</p>
</li>
<li><p>OpenNode: Similar to BTCPay Server, it also has plugins to platforms like <a href="https://www.bigcommerce.com.au/apps/opennode-bitcoin-payments/">BigCommerce</a>, <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/opennode">Shopify</a>, and <a href="https://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=marketplace/extension/info&amp;extension_id=35481&amp;filter_member=opennode">OpenCart</a>. But it provides a <a href="https://opennode.com/hosted-checkout/">hosted payment processing service</a>. Reliance on a third-party platform, however, can raise concerns in the long-term on security.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Strike: <a href="https://strike.me/learn/what-is-the-strike-api/">Strike API</a> enables the sending and receiving of payments via Lightning Network, directing payments to specific users, making cash payouts to bank accounts, and using OAuth for third-party permissions. In terms of payment experience, limitations can arise in terms of customization and flexibility.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Development with WebLN</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.webln.guide/introduction/what-is-webln">WebLN</a> is a JavaScript interface standard that bridges web applications and the Lightning Network, allowing for easy integration of Lightning functionality into web applications. There are also WebLN <a href="https://www.webln.guide/ressources/webln-providers">providers</a>, such as <a href="https://getalby.com/">Alby</a>, which provide their own API service (<a href="https://guides.getalby.com/developer-guide/v/alby-wallet-api">Alby API</a>) to enable instant payments.</p>
<p>However, direct integration needs a reasonable amount of web development experience and if you don&#39;t want to or haven&#39;t built a web application from scratch for your business, this will not be the best option.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Lightning Network enables fast, low-cost transactions, improving payment experiences and reducing operational expenses for businesses. Whether you take a streamlined or more hands-on approach, online businesses can now easily use and accept Lightning payments.
